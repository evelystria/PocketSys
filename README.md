# PocketSys (version Beta-01-19/4/17)
-Inactive-

## Libraries used
PIL, PyMySQL

## Note!
Due to the lack of resources and time, I've stopped developing it. I've released the source code online for anyone who wish to see, learn and maybe further improve it.

Obviously this is not well coded, but it may serve as a pedagogy for beginners to learn!

For those facing issues debugging because of the code which uses 2 image files, 'profile.jpg' and 'Quiz.png' which I did not provide with the repository, simply replace it with other images, or don't use any.
