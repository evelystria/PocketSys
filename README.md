# PocketSys (version Beta-01-19/4/17)
> Written to test functionality between **cross** python files and **mysql** connection.

## Libraries
PIL, PyMySQL

## NOTE!!! INACTIVTE
No longer further developing this. I've released the source code online for anyone who wish to see, learn and maybe further improve it.

Obviously this is not well coded, but it may serve as a pedagogy for beginners to learn!

For those facing issues debugging because of the code which uses 2 image files, 'profile.jpg' and 'Quiz.png' which I did not provide with the repository, simply replace it with other images, or don't use any.

Also, the program uses mysql connection to connect to the database, therefore you will need one for it to work or just make neccessary changes to the code.
