## Note!
Due to the lack of resources and time, I've stopped developing it. Partially becuase I am lazy to continue thus I've released the source code online for anyone who wish to see, learn and maybe further improve it.

Obviously this is not well coded, but it may serve as a pedagogy for beginners to learn!

Also, you may face issues when debugging because the code uses 2 image files, 'profile.jpg' and 'Quiz.png' which I did not provide with the repository. Simply replace it with other images, or don't use any.
