# PocketSys
PocketSys is lightweight app developed catering to Republic Polytechnic students. It prepares the students for their examiniations but providing them with short MCQ-quizzes, as well as a search engine to browse their online library easily for resources.

My idea was to code this app and learn new things along the way after experiencing python for a while.
