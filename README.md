## Note!
Due to the lack of resources and time, the development of this app has stopped. Another reason I am so lazy to continue this, I've released it online here with the source code for anyone who wish to see, learn and maybe further improve it.

Obviously this is not well coded, but it may serve as a pedagogy for beginners to learn!

Also, you may face issues when debugging because the code uses 2 image files, 'profile.jpg' and 'Quiz.png' which I did not provide with the repository. Simply replace it with other images, or don't use any.
