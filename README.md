# PocketSys
PocketSys is lightweight app developed catering to Republic Polytechnic students. It prepares the students for their examiniations but providing them with short MCQ-quizzes, as well as a search engine to browse their online library easily for resources.

My idea was to code this app and learn new things along the way after experiencing python for a while.

Written in python 3

## Features
+ Profile system
+ Quiz
+ Browse online library

The profile system allows the viewing of user's profile which includes; Username, given name, school, course. Also tracks information about their quiz records; history, recent scores. Based on user's school and course, the quiz system will create a drop-down list showing their course's modules. Quiz questions will based upon the proceeding module user selected. Online library allows users to enter queries into the search bar, which will redirect them to opening a browser with their findings.

## Functionality
App is as user-friendly as possible. Certain information and errors are prompted as soon as needed.

Currently how this app functions is that it connects to a local mysql database every time it needs to retrieve user's information. Such as registering users information, logging in, these requires a connection. As it is in development, this will be the norm; however would be changed once I have finished coding.

## Progress
Due to the lack of resources and time, the development of this app has stopped. Another reason I am so lazy to continue this, I've released it online here with the source code for anyone who wish to see, learn and maybe further improve it.

Obviously this is not well coded, but it may serve as a pedagogy for beginners to learn!

Also, you may face issues when debugging because the code uses 2 images, 'profile.jpg' and 'Quiz.png' which I did not provide in the repository. Simply replace it with other images, or don't use any.
